# Diabetes-Prediction-Deployment-Using-Streamlit
This is the final project given in the Yay python Advanced Course. In this project we can predict a person having diabetes or not.


In this projct I have used the joblib library to create the model for future use.
And this project is deployed by using Streamlit library.

There is one video present showing the output on different inputs featues required for prediction of diabetes.
